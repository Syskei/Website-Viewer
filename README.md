# Website-Viewer
Opens incognito brave browser windows which visit a site that you input and closes it after viewing, and then repeats process. If you input multiple sites, it will choose a random site each time a window is opened. You can save and load sites to and from text files.

There is a 4 hour timer on it currently, to prevent abuse however there probably are ways to bypass this easily. Regardless, I tried. 

Obvious tips - 
- ALL SITES MUST START WITH HTTPS:// OR HTTP:// OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK!!!
- You need to have Brave browser installed and if you want to change the browser it uses, make sure it is chromium and you know the path and change it in the source.
- This will drain some Ram as it is opening and closing windows of a chromium browser which typically eat ram
- If you want to change speeds of things like opening or waiting for loading of the windows, change it in the source and build it as an exe with pyinstaller, or just run it as a py file.
- You are free to fork this as long as you credit me
