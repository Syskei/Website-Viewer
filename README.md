# Website-Viewer
Opens incognito brave browser windows which visit a site that you input and closes it after viewing, and then repeats process. If you input multiple sites, it will choose a random site each time a window is opened. You can save and load sites to and from text files.

There is a 4 hour timer on it currently, to prevent abuse however there probably are ways to bypass this easily. Regardless, I tried. 

ALL SITES MUST START WITH HTTPS:// OR HTTP:// OR ELSE IT WILL NOT WORK!!!
